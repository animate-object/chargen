# Automates the character generation process for DnD characters

This is an API and CLI wrapper for randomly generating DnD characters quickly. 
The data returned can be a springboard for character ideas that may be novel.

It is NOT intended to be a replacement for core rulebooks etc., and does not contain mechanical information beyond statistics.
